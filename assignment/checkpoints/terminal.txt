# 1 - What is the command for listing the files in the current folder (directory)?

--- The command is `ls` (can also use `ls -la` to view hidden files)


# 2 - What is the command for changing directories?

--- Use `cd <dir-name>` to move into a directory.
--- --- If you begin typing, you can use TAB to auto-complete the directory name.


# 3 - What is the command for going "up" a folder (to a parent directory)?

--- You can do `cd ..` to navigate up exactly one (1) directory.
--- --- Move multiple directories by chaining together `/..` after the initial `cd ..` 


# 4 - What is a quick way to create a new folder?

--- Use the command line phrase `mkdir <dir-name>` to quickly create a new directory in the current folder


# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty folder? What about a folder containing files?

--- The response should be blank as nothing exists in the empty directory.


# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?

--- That command outputs the current locally utilized version of GIT.
--- --- My computer gives the response `git version 2.15.0`


# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?

--- That status allows users to track if any files have been modified, deleted, or are untracked.
--- --- It is a quick way for users to verify if their work is being properly tracked and updated via GIT


# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?

--- By specifying the `.` in that command, GIT will automatically stage ALL files within the working directory for tracking.
--- --- If you only want to track specific files, you will need to either list those files specifically seperated with a space,
--- --- or add the files you do NOT want to track into the `.gitignore` file.


# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?

--- To upload the committed files to GitHub, issue the command `git push origin <branch-name>`
--- ---  Currently working on the `main` branch for this project, so that command would be `git push origin main`
